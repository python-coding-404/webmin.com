# Webmin Documentation

The primary source of Webmin documentation is now the [Webmin Wiki][1]. If you are looking for instructions on how to use the various modules, you should go direct to the [module documentation pages][2].

Since this is a Wiki, we welcome anyone to sign up and contribute documentation for both core modules and those written by other developers. At the moment the documentation is a work in progress with some screenshots missing or out of date, but I plan to correct this shortly.
