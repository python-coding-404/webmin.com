This new version adds password protection for KVM VMC consoles, makes use of LVM snapshots for cloning Xen and KVM systems, adds API commands for mounting and un-mounting virtual disks, lets you leave disk images behind when deleting a system, and fixes several small bugs. <br />
 Current users will be able to install it from our YUM and APT repositories. An installer for the Xen-only GPL version is available on the [Cloudmin GPL Installer][1] page.
