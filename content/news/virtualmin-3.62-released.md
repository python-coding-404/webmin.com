This update adds a new default sorting mode for Virtual servers (by domain, with sub-servers indented), a template option for SPF included domains, the list-domains.pl API script, Procmail locking to prevent multiple concurrent SpamAssassin processes, the use of Gnu TAR on FreeBSD systems, and a bunch of small bugfixes. Get it from the [Virtualmin downloads][1] page, or from our APT and YUM repositories.
