A new development version of Webmin is now available, with support for storing users, groups and their permissions in LDAP, MySQL or PostgreSQL databases. It can be downloaded in RPM, Debian package or tar.gz formats from [the development versions][1] page. Using a remote database to store users and groups allows Webmin permissions to be shared between multiple systems, and is more scalable than the text files Webmin used in the past.
