This update adds support for LVM thin pools, enforces use of regular ethernet device names, improves VirtIO configuration, handles bridge and VG changes when restoring VMs on a new host, and fixes a bunch of small bugs. <br />
 Current users will be able to install it from our YUM and APT repositories. An installer for the Xen and KVM GPL version is available on the [Cloudmin GPL for Xen][1] and [Cloudmin GPL for KVM][2] pages.
