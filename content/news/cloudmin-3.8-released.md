Cloudmin is a commercial product built on top of Webmin for managing virtual systems, such as Xen, LVM, OpenVZ, Solaris Zones, VServers and EC2. Version 3.8 contains support for multi-system rule-based alerts, reduces temp space needed for Xen backups, allows CPU and memory limits to be edited for Solaris zones, and makes email-related settings easier to edit.
