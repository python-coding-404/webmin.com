This update improves support for LXC 1.0, automates the process of setting on Xen and KVM host systems, allows VMs to be created based on the size of a plan, adds an option to setup Cloudmin Services at VM creation time, and fixes a bunch of other small bugs. <br />
 Current users will be able to install it from our YUM and APT repositories. An installer for the Xen and KVM GPL version is available on the [Cloudmin GPL for Xen][1] and [Cloudmin GPL for KVM][2] pages.
