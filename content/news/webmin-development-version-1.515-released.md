This new testing version moves Webmin's cron jobs for collecting system information and time synchronization into a new internal cron-like service, which uses no additional RAM when run. It also fixes numerous small bugs, adds online LVM resizing and [much more][1]. If you want to try it out, it can be downloaded from the [development versions page][2].
