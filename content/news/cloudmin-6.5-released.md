The new version includes the ability to set the number of cores on KVM systems, perform package installs across multiple VMs, limit the IO class available to system owners, and prevent KVM systems from using IPs not assigned to them. It also fixes the restore process to resize disks to match backups for Xen and KVM systems. <br />
 Current users will be able to install it from our YUM and APT repositories. An installer for the Xen and KVM GPL version is available on the [Cloudmin GPL for Xen][1] and [Cloudmin GPL for KVM][2] pages.
