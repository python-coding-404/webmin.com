This new version adds support for CentOS 7 hosts and VMs (including XFS filesystems), the ability to SSH into systems as a non-root sudo-capable user, and full support for creating and managing Google Compute Engine instances (in a similar manner to Amazon EC2). <br />
 Current users will be able to install it from our YUM and APT repositories. An installer for the Xen and KVM GPL version is available on the [Cloudmin GPL for Xen][1] and [Cloudmin GPL for KVM][2] pages.
