This new release moves Apache logs to /var/log/virtualmin by default, adds optoinal spamtrap and hamtrap aliases to new domains, adds a Preview link for viewing websites, an option to automatically restart down services, and [much much more][1]. You can get it from the [Virtualmin downloads page][2], or from one of our YUM or APT repositories.
