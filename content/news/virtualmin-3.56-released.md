This new version adds support for custom per-domain fields, fixes many bugs in migrating cPanel and Plesk backups (and reduces memory needed), allows FTP chroot directories to be easily configured, avoids username prefix clashes, and supports internationalized domain names. Get it from the [Virtualmin download][1] page.
