This update adds more variables for pre- and post- change scripts, checks for MySQL and PostgreSQL installs with no root password, ensures that scheduled backup emails are only sent to owners of their respective domains, and fixes a bunch of small bugs. You can get it from the [Virtualmin download][1] page.
