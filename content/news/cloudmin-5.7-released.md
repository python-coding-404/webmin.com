This major update includes the ability to set separate maximum and guaranteed memory limits for OpenVZ systems, options to allow memory over-comitting on hosts, support for adding disks and network interfaces to running KVM instances, and pause, resume and live migration support for KVM. It also includes numerous bugfixes and other minor improvements. <br />
 Current users will be able to install it from our YUM and APT repositories. An installer for the Xen and KVM GPL version is available on the [Cloudmin GPL for Xen][1] and [Cloudmin GPL for KVM][2] pages.
