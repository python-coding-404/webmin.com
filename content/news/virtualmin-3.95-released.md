This is mainly a bugfix release, but also includes a change to run pre- and post-backup commands from the web UI, an API command to fix domain quotas, and a bunch of script installer updates. You can get it from the [Virtualmin downloads page][1], and it will soon show up in our YUM and APT repositories.
