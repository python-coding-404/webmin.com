Paid AMIs are new product offered by Amazon that allows you to purchase an EC2 image containing commercial software, and be billed for it by the month by Amazonm, who then pays the software vendor. Since this is a pretty cool new idea, we have created a [paid AMI for Virtualmin Pro][1], which makes getting it running on EC2 even simpler.<br />
 And of course there is still the [free AMI for Virtualmin GPL][2] available.
