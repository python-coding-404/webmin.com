This update adds Docker Volume support, allows Docker images to be created and selected by tag when creating a container, adds the ability to trigger background execution of a scheduled backup, lets you select the storage location for KVM and Xen instance disks at creation time, and fixes a bunch of other small bugs. <br />
 Current users will be able to install it from our YUM and APT repositories. An installer for the Xen and KVM GPL version is available on the [Cloudmin GPL for Xen][1] and [Cloudmin GPL for KVM][2] pages.
