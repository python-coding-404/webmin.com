This new version allows virtual disk to be moved between LVM, regular files and iSCSI servers, makes the accounting of bandwidth and resource use to system owners more accurate, and fixes numerous other minor bugs. <br />
 Current users will be able to install it from our YUM and APT repositories. An installer for the Xen and KVM GPL version is available on the [Cloudmin GPL for Xen][1] and [Cloudmin GPL for KVM][2] pages.
