This update includes the ability to exclude disks from backups, uses the new backup format for Citrix Xen, and simplifies the process of adding a host system. The DNS roundrobin page now supports specification of arbitrary candidate systems by IP, limiting the number of IPs to include in the DNS record, and the ability to automatically configure a proxy balancer on a remote Virtualmin system to use active backend servers. <br />
 Current users will be able to install it from our YUM and APT repositories. An installer for the Xen and KVM GPL version is available on the [Cloudmin GPL for Xen][1] and [Cloudmin GPL for KVM][2] pages.
