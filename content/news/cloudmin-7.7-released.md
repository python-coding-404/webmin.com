This release adds disk space limits for LVM containers (using LVM), a file manager that can manipulate files on managed systems (including VMs that are shut down), an improved display of free disk and RAM on hosts, alert notification improvements and other small features and bugfixes. <br />
 Current users will be able to install it from our YUM and APT repositories. An installer for the Xen and KVM GPL version is available on the [Cloudmin GPL for Xen][1] and [Cloudmin GPL for KVM][2] pages.
