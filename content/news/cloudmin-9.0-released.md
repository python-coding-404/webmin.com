This major update makes the new Authentic theme the default, adds support for Docker containers as a new virtualization type (in the Pro version), updates the Xen support to handle the new xl API command, allows Virtualmin backups to be scheduled across multiple systems, and more. <br />
 Current users will be able to install it from our YUM and APT repositories. An installer for the Xen and KVM GPL version is available on the [Cloudmin GPL for Xen][1] and [Cloudmin GPL for KVM][2] pages.
