This new release fixes bandwidth collection for HVM Xen instances and KVM systems, allows selection of an LVM volume group for new disks, supports Xen systems using whole-disk images, allows the admin to control which interfaces are used for bandwidth collection, and fixes several bugs. <br />
 Current users will be able to install it from our YUM and APT repositories. An installer for the Xen and KVM GPL version is available on the [Cloudmin GPL for Xen][1] and [Cloudmin GPL for KVM][2] pages.
