This new version adds support for the LXC virtualization type, the ability to create roundrobin DNS entries that are automatically updated to point to live systems, links to view the SSH and Webmin passwords for a virtual system, and more. <br />
 Current users will be able to install it from our YUM and APT repositories. An installer for the Xen and KVM GPL version is available on the [Cloudmin GPL for Xen][1] and [Cloudmin GPL for KVM][2] pages.
