This release updates a bunch of script installers, adds security improvements to ensure that file operations on home directories are done with the correct permissions, adds a page for associating and disassociating features, makes the hash format for SSL certs selectable, and [more][1]. You can get the GPL version from the [Virtualmin downloads page][2], or from our YUM and APT repositories.
