This release adds support for importing image files from Stacklet, re-designs the page for manually adding images, allows multiple stats to be graphed for a single system, lets you limit how long stats are kept for, and fixes a bunch of minor bugs. <br />
 Current users will be able to install it from our YUM and APT repositories. An installer for the Xen and KVM GPL version is available on the [Cloudmin GPL for Xen][1] and [Cloudmin GPL for KVM][2] pages.
