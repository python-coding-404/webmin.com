This is mainly a bugfix release, but also includes API consistency improvements, better Ubuntu 12.04 VM support, cleaner host bridge selection, better detection of remote command failures and improved progress indicators. <br />
 Current users will be able to install it from our YUM and APT repositories. An installer for the Xen and KVM GPL version is available on the [Cloudmin GPL for Xen][1] and [Cloudmin GPL for KVM][2] pages.
