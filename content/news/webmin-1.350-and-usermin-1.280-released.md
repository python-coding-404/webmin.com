No really major new features in these releases, just a bunch of bugfixes and enhancements. The biggest are probably RHEL 5 support, and the removal of useless files from the HTML editor which actually make the packages smaller! See the [Webmin change log][1] or [Usermin change log][2] for details, or download using the links to the left.
