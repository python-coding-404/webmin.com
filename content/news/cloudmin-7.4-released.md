This update primarily fixes bugs related to Xen 4.x, which moves the location of VM settings out of .cfg files. It also fixes a couple of other minor issues with Citrix Xen support. <br />
 Current users will be able to install it from our YUM and APT repositories. An installer for the Xen and KVM GPL version is available on the [Cloudmin GPL for Xen][1] and [Cloudmin GPL for KVM][2] pages.
