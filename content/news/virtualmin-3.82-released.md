This is mainly a bugfix release, which resolves problems with DKIM setup and creation of alias domains. It also adds the ability to backup to multiple destinations, control the maximum message size for spam filtering, lets you control which skeleton files get template substituted, and makes the output of API commands that list quotas more programmer-friendly.<br />
 You can get it from the [Virtualmin downloads page][1], and it will soon show up in our YUM and APT repositories.
