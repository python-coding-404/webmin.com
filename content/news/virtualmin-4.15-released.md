This release adds support for backing up to Dropbox (in the Pro version), a page showing currently running backups, UI fields and API options for edting users' password recovery addresses, and a bunch of script installer updates. It also replaces Dkim-Milter with OpenDKIM on CentOS 7 systems. <br />
 You can get the GPL version from the [Virtualmin downloads page][1], or from our YUM and APT repositories.
