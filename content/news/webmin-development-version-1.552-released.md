This minor version adds support for using Parted to manage Linux disk partitions, which means that disks above 2T in size can now be fully used with the new GPT partition table format. It also makes links to Unix users and DNS records be by name instead of index, making them more reliable when dynamic DNS or other tools are being used. It can be downloaded in RPM, Debian package or tar.gz formats from [the development versions][1] page.
