Webmin.com is hosted by sourceforge, who recently moved all their servers to a new datacenter is Chicago. Apart from some MySQL glitches that effect the third-party modules database, the migration is now complete and the Webmin site should be up and running again. If not, [email me][1] with any problems you notice.
