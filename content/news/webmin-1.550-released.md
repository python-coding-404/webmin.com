This release includes a fix for an XSS attack reported by Javier Bassi that can be triggered if un-trusted users are allowed to change the real names of Unix users on your system. It also includes support for Ubuntu's new Upstart boot system, and several other [new small features][1]. You can get it from the [Webmin downloads page][2], or from our YUM or APT repositories.
