This release adds the Change IP Addresses page, adds email aliases that forward to all users in a domain, supports SSL keys with passphrases, fixes the way Clamd's init script is setup, and allows you to use a remote Clamd server with clamd-stream-client. Get it from the [Virtualmin downloads][1] page, or from our APT and YUM repositories.
