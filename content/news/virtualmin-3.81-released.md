This new release adds DKIM signing support, makes changing the IP address of a virtual server less confusing, makes keeping a fixed MySQL login for a domain simpler, adds parallel bzip2 support, speeds up the restore of large backups from SSH or FTP destinations, and [much more][1]. You can get it from the [Virtualmin downloads page][2], and it will soon show up in our YUM and APT repositories.
