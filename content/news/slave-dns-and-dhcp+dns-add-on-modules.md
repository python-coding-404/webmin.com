I've recently created two new Webmin modules - the first is a Virtualmin [plugin][1] that allows domains to have a slave DNS zone on the local system. This is useful when the real DNS domain is hosted by someone else, but you want to easily setup a secondary that is under the control of the domain owner. You can get it from here : [virtualmin-slavedns.wbm.gz][2].
