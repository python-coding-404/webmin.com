This new version adds webmail and admin DNS aliases to new domains, a page for setting global variables for use in templates, support for editing included domains in SPF records, Module Config options for a custom logo, Dutch updates, and many other [small features and bug fixes][1]. Get it from the [Virtualmin downloads][2] page. <br />
 Several of the [Virtualmin plugins][3] have also been updated, mostly with Dutch translations thanks to Gandyman.
