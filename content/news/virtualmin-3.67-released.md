This major update includes numerous new features and bugfixes, the biggest of which is a major reduction in memory use when combined with Webmin 1.470 or later. It also adds Plesk 9 migration support, account plan cloning, default feature selection from plans, pre and post-alias modification commands, and [much more][1].
