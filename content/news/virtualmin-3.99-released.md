This version adds the ability to enable or disable server-side includes, supports separately install PHP 5.3 and 5.4 packages, makes the DKIM key size configurable, changes default mail folder names, adds an option to change email behavior when a domain is over quota, and much more. You can get the GPL version from the [Virtualmin downloads page][1], and it will soon show up in our YUM and APT repositories.
