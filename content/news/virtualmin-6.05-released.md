This release allows domain owners to restore global backups, adds support for wildcard Let's Encrypt certs, fixes licence updates, and allows the domain name used in links from virtualmin to be customized. <br />
 You can get the GPL version from the [Virtualmin downloads page][1], or from our YUM and APT repositories.
