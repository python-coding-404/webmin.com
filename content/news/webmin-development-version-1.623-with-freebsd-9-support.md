A new development version of Webmin is now available with much improved FreeBSD support, such as the ability to install ports, manage disk slices and partitions, configure IPv6 addresses and much more. You can find the tar.gz package on the [development download page][1]. The version also includes a complete German translation for all new features and modules, thanks to Raymond Vetter.
