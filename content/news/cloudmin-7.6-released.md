This update improves support for XenServer 6, allows importing of Stacklet subscriber images, adds per-image post-creation scripts, adds support for virtual CPUs under OpenVZ, makes single-system backups easier, and fixes a bunch of minor bugs. <br />
 Current users will be able to install it from our YUM and APT repositories. An installer for the Xen and KVM GPL version is available on the [Cloudmin GPL for Xen][1] and [Cloudmin GPL for KVM][2] pages.
