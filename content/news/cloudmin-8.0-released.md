This release fixes a bunch of minor bugs, adds the vnc-system API command for connecting to a VM's console, allows multiple root SSH keys to be set for a system, and makes use of the new Webmin theme API for better integration with third-party themes. <br />
 Current users will be able to install it from our YUM and APT repositories. An installer for the Xen and KVM GPL version is available on the [Cloudmin GPL for Xen][1] and [Cloudmin GPL for KVM][2] pages.
