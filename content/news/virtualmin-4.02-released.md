This release includes multiple script updates, better Apache 2.4 support, German translations from Raymond Vetter, the ability to switch a domain with a private IP to another address, and a bunch of bugfixes. <br />
 You can get the GPL version from the [Virtualmin downloads page][1], and it will soon show up in our YUM and APT repositories.
