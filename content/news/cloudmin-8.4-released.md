This release adds per-owner bridge limits, LXC 1.1 support, numerous fixes for newer OpenVZ and KVM versions, better handling of locked and shut-down VMs, timeouts for all remote commands (to prevent hung Cloudmin operations), and a whole bunch of other minor bugfixes. <br />
 Current users will be able to install it from our YUM and APT repositories. An installer for the Xen and KVM GPL version is available on the [Cloudmin GPL for Xen][1] and [Cloudmin GPL for KVM][2] pages.
