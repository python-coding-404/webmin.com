# For Users

Users of Webmin, Usermin or Virtualmin looking for support should post to either the [mailing list][1] or the [Webmin forum][2] hosted by SourceForge.

If you have found what looks like a bug, post it to the [ Webmin bug tracker][3] or [Usermin bug tracker][4].

If you just want to be informed of new releases, sign up for the [Webmin announcements mailing list][5], or check back at this website regularly.

# For Developers

Anyone wanting to write their own Webmin modules or contribute to the core distribution should first read the [module writer's guide][6]. For support, join the [development mailing list][7], or [email me directly][8].

If you have created your own module or theme, please post it on the [third-party modules list][9]. Patches to the Webmin core modules should be [sent to me][10] for vetting and inclusion in future releases.

If you want to work on core Webmin code, check out the page on using the [Webmin Git repository][11], which is hosted on Github.

# For Translators

New and updated translations for Webmin modules are always welcome. You should read the documentation on [creating translations][12], and then download the [wbmtranslator][13] Webmin module, which makes it easy to edit and submit new languages.
