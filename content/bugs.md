# Bug Tracking System

This is the main page of the Webmin bug database, which has now been moved to the Sourceforge bug tracking system. It keeps track of bugs, feature requests, solutions and updates, and allows users who find a problem to search for it in the database or submit it if it is not already there.

The bug database options available are :

* **Submit a new bug**
    If you find a problem in Webmin, you can [add it to the bug database][1]. If you are reporting a bug, please include information about the operating system you are running Webmin on (like CentOS 7, Debina 8 or Solaris 10), the browser that you are using to access it (such as Chrome or Firefox), and the version of Webmin you are running.
    Unless you create a Sourceforge account before submitting your bug, you will not be notified when it is updated or solved. Please check back with it frequently, so that you can see the solution or answer any additional questions.
* **Search the bug database**
    The Sourceforge bug list for Webmin can be searched by entering search terms below. You should always check to see if the bug you are about to report has been already submitted by someone else.
