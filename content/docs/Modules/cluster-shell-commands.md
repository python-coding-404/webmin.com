### About
The **Cluster Shell Commands** module is similar to [Command Shell](/docs/modules/command-shell), but allows simple commands to be run on multiple servers concurrently instead of just on this server. On the main page you can enter a command to run (or select an old one), and choose one or more servers or groups to execute it on. Only servers that have been created in the [Webmin Servers Index](/docs/modules/webmin-servers-index) module with a login and password will appear in the list.
