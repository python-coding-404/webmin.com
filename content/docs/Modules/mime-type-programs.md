### Intro
MIME Types is the method by which the server, and its clients, know what type of data a given object is. This information is generally more important to the client, as they must know how to interpret the data where the server only needs to send it to the client along with MIME identification information. MIME, or Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions was originally defined to easily allow sending of data other than text via email. It has now become the standard method for many types of network connection to declare data type.

### About
The MIME Types Programs Webmin module merely provides a list of the currently accepted MIME types, and their optional extensions.
