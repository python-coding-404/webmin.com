### Language
As explained on [Webmin Configuration](/docs/webmin/webmin-configuration), Webmin supports multiple languages for its web interface.

You can select a different language to be displayed for the currently logged in user as follows:
- Open the ****Change Language and Theme**** module under the ****Webmin**** category.
- In the ****Language**** field, select ****Personal choice**** and select a language from the menu.
- Click ****Make Changes****.

### Locale
Webmin supports numerous locales, which define how date and time is presented in Webmin UI. To change the locale for the currently logged in user do the following:
- Open the ****Change Language and Theme**** module under the ****Webmin**** category.
- In the ****Locale**** field, select ****Personal choice**** and select a locale from the menu.
- Click ****Make Changes****.


### Theme
Webmin also supports multiple user interface themes, which define the page layout, color scheme and many types. To change the theme for your current login only, do the following:
- Open the ****Change Language and Theme**** module under the ****Webmin**** category.
- In the ****Theme**** field, select ****Personal choice**** and select a theme from the menu.
