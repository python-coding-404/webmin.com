### Intro

This wiki is intended to be a complete set of documentation for Webmin and all of its modules. We've seeded it with imported content from **Jamie Cameron**'s book _Managing Linux Systems with Webmin: System Administration & Module Development_ and **Joe Cooper**'s book _The Book of Webmin or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying & Love UNIX_, and various FAQs and articles previously written by Jamie and Joe.

All told, it's about 1,000 printed pages worth of documentation. But, it's not finished. In fact, it's just begun! Now, it's your turn. Get Involved!

### Modules
Webmin includes a heap (110+) standard modules, and there are at least as many third party modules. Modules are grouped as Webmin, System, Servers, Tools, Networking, Hardware, and Cluster. Webmin also has an "Un-used Modules" category, which will contain modules for software not (yet) installed on a given system. Use the "Refresh Modules" menu-item to update the currently available modules on your system.

### Get Involved

The documentation here is copious, but still incomplete. Webmin is a huge project with over a hundred standard modules and a couple hundred third party modules. Jamie's book covered most of the standard modules that existed in 2003 in reference form, and Joe covered a popular subset with more of a focus on teaching concepts. In both cases, the documentation has become somewhat dated and Webmin has advanced far beyond where it was back then. Modules are easier to write, themes easier to build, and capabilities in some of the core modules have become quite advanced. Cluster features have become central to the Webmin way, and lots of new modules have been introduced or modified to support multiple servers.

Many folks in the Webmin community have discussed the documentation problem, and the obvious solution is a wiki!

Now we need your help.
