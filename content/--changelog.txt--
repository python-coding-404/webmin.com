* Fixed another XSS bug in chooser.cgi.

* Added an ACL option to the file chooser for additional directories to allow access to.
* Changed the way sizes are displayed, to use a format like 1.32 GB or 8 kB.
* Removed letter images (used by the old theme), and forced the standard header function to always use text titles.

* Fixed XSS bugs in chooser.cgi.
* If the operating system is upgraded after Webmin is installed, a button is displayed on the main page to update Webmin's view of the current OS.
* Improved the tabs API to add an option to put a box around the visible tab, and whitespace around tabs.

* SELinux security contexts are preserved on files safely modified by Webmin's write-and-rename code.
* Added xmlrpc.cgi program, which provides an XML-RPC interface to all Webmin module functions.
* Tested and improved support for Fedora 5.

### Version 1.280
* Fixed security holes that allow remote read access to any file on the server for which the path is known.

### Version 1.270
* Updated almost all modules that use tables to use the new `ui_columns` functions. This allows themes to do highlighting when a row is moved over or selected.
* Added a new 'Simple Blue' theme, which uses fewer images and does table row highlighting.
* Changed the way that Webmin log diff files are stored, so that they are categorized by action and not all in one huge directory.

### Version 1.260
* Proxy settings made in the Webmin Configuration module are passed on to programs Webmin calls via the `http_proxy` and `ftp_proxy` environment variables.

* Replaced all calls to the crypt() function with new code that will use the Crypt::UnixCrypt Perl modules on systems for with crypt() is broken.

* Added basic support for running Webmin on Windows system with ActiveState Perl installed. The new `setup.pl` install script must be used, as the setup.sh shell script cannot run on Windows.
* Fixed a bug that could allow a remote attack if the option to use full PAM conversations is enabled.
* Improved the Webmin RPM to not lose the /etc/webmin directory when upgrading from an RPM by another vendor (like Mandrake or DAG).

### Version 1.210
* Added a new Global ACL control option to limit a user to read-only mode. This does not yet support all modules, but in those that are supported any changes the user makes will simply not take effect.
* Restarting of Webmin is now much faster in some modules that do not need a full configuration reload, due to the addition of a function that justs tells `miniserv.pl` to re-read its config file.

### Version 1.200
* On Solaris systems that support RBAC, available modules and access rights can now be derived from RBAC for selected users. This can be enabled on a per-user or per-module basic in the Webmin Users module.

### Version 1.180
* All subheadings have been reduced in size when using the default MSC theme.
* All modules now use a new API for writing to configuration files, which ensures that the file does not get written to or truncated if the system is out of disk space.

### Version 1.170
* When installing a module from the command line, by it will be granted to the same users who receive new modules when Webmin is upgraded. By default, this is root and admin.
* Added basic support for multiple root directories, so that Webmin modules can be separated into core and third-party on the filesystem.
* When installing or upgrading Webmin, password timeouts are now enabled by default. This protects against brute-force password guessing attacks.

### Version 1.160
* Added support for Solaris 10.
* Included several additional translations for various languages and modules.
* Added support for config- files that allow a range of OS version numbers, and used this to reduce the number of standard config files.

### Version 1.150
* Updated the setup.sh script to use MD5 password encryption by default, on systems where Perl supports it.
* Fixed a security hole in the `maketemp.pl` script, used to create the /tmp/.webmin directory at install time. If an un-trusted user creates this directory before Webmin is installed, he could create in it a symbolic link pointing to a critical file on the system, which would be overwritten when Webmin writes to the link filename (CVE bug CAN-2004-0559).
* When PAM is used for Unix authentication, expired passwords are now detected and the user is prompted to select a new password (if this feature is enabled on the Webmin Configuration module).
* Make all functions in `ui-lib.pl` themable, allowing themes to have more detailed control over modules that make use of this library.
* Updated all modules to call `ui_print_header` instead of calling header and printing `<hr>`, so that themes can avoid the `<hr>`. Also updated the MSC theme to do this.

### Version 1.140
* Fixed a security hole that allowed any user to view the configuration of any module, even those that they should not have access to.
* Fixed a security hole that could allow an attacker to lock valid users by sending a bogus username or password.
