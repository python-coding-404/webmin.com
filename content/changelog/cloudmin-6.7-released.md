This release includes image creation, backup and cloning optimizations when iSCSI is in use, better calculation of free disk space for new VMs and disks, an easier way to add KVM command line parameters, and many other small features and bugfixes. It also moves all background cron jobs to Webmin's built-in cron service, which reduces memory use and startup latency. <br />
 Current users will be able to install it from our YUM and APT repositories. An installer for the Xen and KVM GPL version is available on the [Cloudmin GPL for Xen][1] and [Cloudmin GPL for KVM][2] pages.
