This release adds a flash-based graphical console (no need to install client-side Java!), network rate limiting for Citrix Xen instances, the ability to add existing iSCSI exports to virtual systems, SSH agent support for direct file transfers between systems, and a bunch of bugfixes and minor features. <br />
 Current users will be able to install it from our YUM and APT repositories. An installer for the Xen and KVM GPL version is available on the [Cloudmin GPL for Xen][1] and [Cloudmin GPL for KVM][2] pages.
