This version adds support for per-domain DKIM keys, allows resellers to create other resellers, and improves support for Ubuntu 14.04 and Apache 2.4. The Pro version also includes numerous script installer updates. You can get the GPL version from the [Virtualmin downloads page][1], or from our YUM and APT repositories.
