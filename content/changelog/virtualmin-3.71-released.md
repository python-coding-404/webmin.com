This is mainly a bugfix release, to address issues introduced by the security fixes in the 3.70 version. It also includes support for backups by plan, fixes home-less alias domain backups, and calls the pre-change command before doing a restore. You can get it from the [Virtualmin downloads page][1], or from one of our YUM or APT repositories. Also available from the same location are updates to the framed theme, and the SVN, DAV, protected directories and mail relay plugins.
