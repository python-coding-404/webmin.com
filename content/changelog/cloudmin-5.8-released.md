This major update improves the backup format for Xen and KVM instances with multiple disks to reduce temporary space used on host systems, allows network bridge selection at VM creation time, speeds up multiple package updates, reduces delays in collection of system status, allows the SSH port to be set for new VMs, and fixes numerous small bugs. <br />
 Current users will be able to install it from our YUM and APT repositories. An installer for the Xen and KVM GPL version is available on the [Cloudmin GPL for Xen][1] and [Cloudmin GPL for KVM][2] pages.
