This new release includes an improved page for changing a system's password, system alerts on network use, CPU limits for KVM instances, the ability to manage network interface on non-Linux VMs, bridge editing for existing VM interfaces, a new page for defining custom links like in Virtualmin, and numerous bug fixes. <br />
