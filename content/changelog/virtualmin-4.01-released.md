This release includes the ability to manage expiration, Glacier migration and ACLs on S3 buckets, German translations by Raymond Vetter, a sample DNS records page, and the ability to update slave DNS servers when the master system's IP changes. <br />
 You can get the GPL version from the [Virtualmin downloads page][1], and it will soon show up in our YUM and APT repositories.
