Looking for a cool new theme that completely changes the look of Webmin and makes it appear much more modern? If so, try out the Bootstrap based [Authentic Theme][1] by Ilia Rostovtsev (a.k.a. [@iliajie](/about/#developers)). You can install it using the Webmin Configuration module, on the Webmin Themes page.
