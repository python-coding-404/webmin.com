This update includes the ability for plugins to replace Apache with another webserver (like Nginx), preserves mailboxes and aliase when email is disabled for a domain, allows domain creation when a clashing MySQL database already exists, includes Dovecot control files in backups, adds MySQL size selection to the post-install wizard, and [much more][1].
