A new development version of Webmin is now available, with support for storing users, groups and their permissions in LDAP, MySQL or PostgreSQL databases. Using a remote database to store users and groups allows Webmin permissions to be shared between multiple systems, and is more scalable than the text files Webmin used in the past.
