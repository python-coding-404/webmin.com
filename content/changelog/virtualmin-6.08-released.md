This new version adds MariaDB 10 support, fixes Dropbox and FPM bugs, adds the ability to backup by reseller, and fixes security issues that could be exploited by domain owners (thanks to RACK911 Labs for finding and reporting these). <br />
 You can get the GPL version from the [Virtualmin downloads page][1], or from our YUM and APT repositories.
