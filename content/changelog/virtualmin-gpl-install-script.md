If you want to install Virtualmin GPL, Webmin, Usermin and all the related servers like Apache and Postfix on a CentOS 5 or Debian 4.0 system, we have a new install script just for you! Instructions on how to use it are on the [Virtualmin GPL Installer][1] page. I highly recommend this if you are setting up a brand new system, as it takes a **lot** of the work out of initial server configuration.
