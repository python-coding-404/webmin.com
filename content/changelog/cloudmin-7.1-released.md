This new version adds the ability to create snapshots of VMs and roll back to them, makes image extraction on iSCSI more efficient, and fixes several bugs in the 7.0 release. <br />
 Current users will be able to install it from our YUM and APT repositories. An installer for the Xen and KVM GPL version is available on the [Cloudmin GPL for Xen][1] and [Cloudmin GPL for KVM][2] pages.
