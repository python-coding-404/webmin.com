This release adds support for automated failovers between host systems with shared storage, records the history of status changes for each system, allows an SSH key to be added to an existing system, fixes the Xen VNC IP address, and lets you set a custom hostname when creating a new system. Current users will be able to install it from our YUM and APT repositories.
