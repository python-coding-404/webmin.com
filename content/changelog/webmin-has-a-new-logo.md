In celebration of Webmin's 10th anniversary, we held a contest to choose a new logo. The competition was fierce, and we received over 350 entries from a few dozen designers. From that illustrious pool of talent, we finally winnowed it down to one logo that goes above and beyond the call of duty. It looks great in all colors (or no color, see above in the header), and should serve Webmin well for years to come. Click on over to the [story on the Webmin blog][1] for the full color and 3D variants of this logo, and the meaning behind this fine looking logo. Webmin's default theme and website will soon see an update to match the feel of the new logo.
