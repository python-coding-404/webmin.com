This release centralizes the configuration of cloud storage providers, adds support for backups to Google Cloud Storage (in the Pro version), makes the address in Apache VirtualHost blocks more consistent, and updates a large number of script installers. You can get the GPL version from the [Virtualmin downloads page][1], or from our YUM and APT repositories.
