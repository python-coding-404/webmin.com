Development version 1.455 is [now available][1], in tar.gz, RPM and Debian package formats. This release includes a major change in the way modules call the core API, which should both reduce memory use and make it run faster. However, since it is wide-ranging change, I'm looking for all the testing I can get to find bugs before the next official release.
