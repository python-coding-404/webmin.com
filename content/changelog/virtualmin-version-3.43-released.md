This release adds the ability to change the home directory or administration login for a domain, makes it easier to specify the primary NS, detects password changes made in other modules, shows the status of Dovecot, and allows MySQL permissions to be pushed to multiple servers. You can get it from the [Virtualmin downloads page][1].
