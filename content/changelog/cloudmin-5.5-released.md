The biggest new feature in this version is support for auto-scaling groups, which can create and destroy virtual systems in response to load. It also adds the ability to clone a system directly to a new host, and allows new EC2 instances to be added to a DNS zone hosted by your Cloudmin master system. <br />
 Current users will be able to install it from our YUM and APT repositories. An installer for the Xen and KVM GPL version is available on the [Cloudmin GPL for Xen][1] and [Cloudmin GPL for KVM][2] pages.
