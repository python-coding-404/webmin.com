This update adds support for VirtIO KVM drives and network interfaces, allows a system owner to be created at the same time as a new system, lets you select the network interface model for Xen and KVM machines, adds a search field to the IP Addresses page, allows searching for systems by owner, improves several API commands to allow searching by host or status, and much more. <br />
 Current users will be able to install it from our YUM and APT repositories. An installer for the Xen-only GPL version is available on the [Cloudmin GPL Installer][1] page.
