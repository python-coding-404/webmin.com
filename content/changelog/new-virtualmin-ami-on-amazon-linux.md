We have created a new Amazon EC2 AMI with ID ami-faea4f93 that can be run for free on EC2 as a "micro" instance. This contains Virtualmin, Webmin, Usermin and all the servers they configure like Apache, Postfix and BIND. The AMI is built on top of Amazon's own Linux distribution, which is similar to Fedora or CentOS Linux.
