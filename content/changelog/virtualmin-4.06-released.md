This release fixes a security issue related to the post-install wizard, fixes a bug that excluded mailboxes from backups, adds an option to delete un-needed files when restoring a backup, and allows the port used in URLS to be set independently of the actual port. You can get the GPL version from the [Virtualmin downloads page][1], or from our YUM and APT repositories.
