- #### 1.070
    - Fixed a security hole that could allow an attacker to lock valid users by sending a bogus username or password.
    - Fixed a bug that stopped user limiting from working when Usermin was run from inetd.
- #### 1.080
    - Fixed a security hole in the maketemp.pl script, used to create the /tmp/.usermin directory at install time. If an un-trusted user creates this directory before Webmin is installed, he could create in it a symbolic link pointing to a critical file on the system, which would be overwritten when Usermin writes to the link filename (CVE bug CAN-2004-0559).
    - When PAM is used for authentication, expired passwords are now detected and the user is prompted to select a new password (if this feature is enabled on the Usermin Configuration module).
- #### 1.090
    - Added support for Solaris 10.
    - Included several additional translations for various languages and modules.
    - Added support for config- files that allow a range of OS version numbers, and used this to reduce the number of standard config files.
- #### 1.100
    - When installing or upgrading Usermin, password timeouts are now enabled by default. This protects against brute-force password guessing attacks.
- #### 1.110
    - All subheadings have been reduced in size with using the default MSC theme.
- #### 1.150
    - Fixed a bug that could allow a remote attack if the option to use full PAM conversations is enabled.
- #### 1.160
    - Replaced all calls to the crypt() function with new code that will use the Crypt::UnixCrypt Perl modules on systems for with crypt() is broken.
- #### 1.170
    - Fixed a possible security hole caused by a bug in Perl.
- #### 1.180
    - Added support for DAV clients.
- #### 1.190
    - The From: address for feedback emails is now taken from the Read Mail module.
    - Proxy settings made in Webmin in the Usermin Configuration module are passed on to programs Usermin calls via the http_proxy and ftp_proxy environment variables.
- #### 1.250
    - When a large file is uploaded, it is no longer read into memory by miniserv.pl.
    - Changed the default theme for all installs to the new framed blue theme.
    - Updated all rows of links (like select all, invert selection, add something) above tables to use a separator between links.
- #### 1.260
    - Improved support for automatic domain name prepending at long time to check the first and second parts of the hostname in the URL.
    - Added support for Slam64 Linux.
    - Fixed XSS bugs in pam_login.cgi.
- #### 1.280
    - Added support for blocking users with too many failed logins, configurable in Webmin's Usermin Configuration module.
