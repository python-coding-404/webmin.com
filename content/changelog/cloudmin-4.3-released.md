This update includes the ability to edit MAC addresses, support for configuring a DHCP server for Xen and KVM instances, IO priorities for backups, more formats for imported images, and a bunch of bug fixes. The new version is available from our YUM and APT repositories right now. See the [Cloudmin page][1] for more information on installing it on a new system.
