In this new version system owners can make use of the remote API, Xen instances can have their memory limits increased without rebooting, and common IP ranges can include multiple addresses (and gateways). Customers will be prompted to upgrade after logging in to Cloudmin, and new users can purchase it from the [Virtualmin shop][1].
