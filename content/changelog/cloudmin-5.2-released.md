This release extends the ability of plugins to add limits for system owners and plans, lets you change a system's owned on the Edit System page, makes system images searchable, adds pre and post-execution commands for backups, and fixes a bunch of small bugs. <br />
 Current users will be able to install it from our YUM and APT repositories. An installer for the Xen-only GPL version is available on the [Cloudmin GPL Installer][1] page.
