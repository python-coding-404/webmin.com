This release includes a new default theme, iSCSI client and server modules, German, Dutch and Norwegian translation updates, status monitoring logging, VLAN and bonding support, UI cleanups, XSS attack fixes and many other small bugfixes and features. You can get it from the [Webmin downloads page][1], or from our YUM or APT repositories. <br />
