This version moves all cron jobs into the Webmin server process (to reduce memory use), adds Thunderbird-style mail client autoconfiguration, an option to disable sub-servers at the same time as their parent, and more. You can get the GPL version from the [Virtualmin downloads page][1], and it will soon show up in our YUM and APT repositories.
