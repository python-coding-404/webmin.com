The biggest new feature in this version of Virtualmin is support for multiple backup schedules, and a new UI for editing them. Domain owners can also schedule, backup and restore (to a limited degree) their domains. Version 3.58 also improves Plesk migration, adds logging for API calls, allows remote MySQL clients to be edited, and adds a full Dutch translation by Gandyman.
