If you are fluent in English and a widely used language (like Spanish, Chinese, French or Portuguese) and want to contribute to Webmin, one way of helping is to submit a translation for modules that are lacking one. To get started, see which [languages have the most coverage][1], and then read the documentation on [how to create translations][2].
