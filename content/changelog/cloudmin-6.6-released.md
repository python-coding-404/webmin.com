The major new feature in this version is support for iSCSI, which allows virtual system disks to be stored on a remote system separate from their hosts. This makes system moves faster, and reduces the amount of storage needed on host systems. Also in this release is improved Xen 4.2 support, and the ability to select systems to backup by host or location group. <br />
 Current users will be able to install it from our YUM and APT repositories. An installer for the Xen and KVM GPL version is available on the [Cloudmin GPL for Xen][1] and [Cloudmin GPL for KVM][2] pages.
