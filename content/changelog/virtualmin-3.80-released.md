This new version copies alias domain DNS records from the target, better supports top-level international domain names, makes the bandwidth monitoring schedule more flexible, and fixes a bunch of small bugs. You can get it from the [Virtualmin downloads page][1], and it will soon show up in our YUM and APT repositories. Also available is an update to the AWstats plugin to fix some broken icon URLs.
